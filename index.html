                  than just pets; they are loved members of the family, like offspring from the growing love that 
                  my girlfriend and I share. These kitties are our shining angels; 
                  they have always supported me and played an instrumental part in our path and story together. </p>

                        but it lasted only briefly. After a stint of idleness and socializing, my dreams of basketball stardom and 
                        academic pursuits dimmed due to financial setbacks. Despite feeling hopeless, I resolved to support my family, 
                        eventually securing a job as a dining staff member.

                        another obstacle arose, dashing my aspirations again. Desperation led me to a dishwasher role, 
                        which eventually opened doors to stable employment at a restaurant. With newfound opportunity 
                        and support from friends, I seized a scholarship for a diploma program called UAQTEA in ISHRM, 
                        reshaping my life's trajectory.

        <h4 class="fs-4 mt-5">How I describe myself</h4>
        <p class="w-100 w-md-75 mt-3 text-justify">I'm Thyrd Alih Tereh, I think of myself as someone who tends to be lazy, but when I find something I'm really passionate about, like cooking, something within of me sparks. My passion for culinary creativity motivates me to take action. I applied as quickly as possible when a position as a kitchen staff member opened up. Those are the times when I am most motivated to go for my goals and go forward with unwavering passion.</p>
        <h4 class="fs-4 mt-5">How other people describe me</h4>
        <p class="w-100 w-md-75 mb-4 text-justify">I'm passionate, hardworking, and clearly family-oriented, according to my girlfriend. She believes that I am someone who is mindful of my priorities and the next step of decision. 
          To be honest, I have no idea how or why she came to have this impression of me. 
          She thinks of me as a fun-loving person who brightens any gloomy situation. 
          the most secure person to rely on, providing comfort and security. In her eyes, I am synonymous with home— a place where vulnerability is embraced, comfort is abundant, and beauty is ever-present
         She noted that although I have a warm smile, I can be very whiny at times. It's insane to think that someone out there views you in a different light, from a different perspective of how you view yourself.</p>
         <h4 class="fs-4 mt-5">Function</h4>
         <p class="w-100 w-md-75 mb-4 text-justify">My standard approach is to "go with the flow" when faced with unfamiliar or challenging situations. 
          I find that instead of persistently fighting against the tide, I simply go with the current and enjoy all that life has to offer. 
          I can easily and adaptably move through uncertainty thanks to this character, looking for opportunities within problems instead 
          of fighting against them. I thrive in the versatility of now, believing that I can stay afloat amid life's waves, 
          whether it is by finding clever solutions to challenging situations or adjusting to abrupt changes.
          Although I take great satisfaction in my capacity to adapt, this flexibility shows itself in more 
          complex aspects of my personality when it comes to dealing with other people. Unfortunately, I've 
          been known to have a toxic side and take things way too personally when I'm presented with negative 
          feelings or experiences. My natural tendency in such situations is to strike back, frequently going 
          against my moral convictions to make sure that perceived injustices receive proper compensation. 
          I strive to overcome my urge towards revenge, which I acknowledge as a problem in myself. 
          It's important to remember, though, that at my core, I am a good person who returns compassion for kindness given to me.</p>

                follow a road blindly, even if it seemed right at first. I have an inbuilt tendency to 
                consider all options, consider the possible outcomes, and look into the underlying reasons 
                for every choice. Even if it can be difficult at times, this tendency toward self-doubt is a 
                result of an intense belief that everything has consequences and trade-offs. What makes me 
                unique is my natural skepticism, which helps me approach life with caution 
                but intelligence and is constantly aware of the complexity that stood beyond the surface.
